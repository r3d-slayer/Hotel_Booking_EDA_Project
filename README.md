📊 Key Insights from the Analysis
1. City Hotels Dominate Bookings
The analysis revealed that City Hotels have a significantly higher number of bookings compared to Resort Hotels, accounting for over 66% of the total. This suggests a higher general demand or capacity for city-based accommodations.

2. Summer is the Peak Season
Booking demand fluctuates significantly throughout the year. The busiest month for hotels is August, followed closely by July. Conversely, the quietest period is during the winter, with January having the fewest bookings. This insight is crucial for staffing and marketing strategies.

3. High Cancellation Rate is a Major Concern
A substantial portion of bookings are canceled, with an overall cancellation rate of approximately 37%. City hotels have a slightly higher cancellation rate (41.7%) compared to resort hotels (27.7%). Addressing this is critical for improving revenue.

4. Majority of Guests are from Europe
Most guests come from Europe, with Portugal (PRT) being the top country of origin. The United Kingdom and France are the next two largest sources of guests, indicating key markets for targeted marketing.

5. Online Travel Agents are the Primary Booking Channel
The Online Travel Agents (Online TA) segment is the largest source of bookings by a wide margin. This highlights the importance of a strong online presence and partnerships with platforms like Booking.com and Expedia.

✨ Conclusion
The analysis provides several actionable insights for hotel management:

Focus on City Hotels: As the primary driver of bookings, strategies to optimize pricing and reduce cancellations should be focused on city hotels.

Implement Seasonal Strategies: Marketing campaigns and staffing levels should be adjusted to match peak (Summer) and off-peak (Winter) seasons.

Manage Cancellations: The high cancellation rate needs to be addressed through strategies like more flexible booking policies, non-refundable offers, or better guest communication.

Leverage Online Channels: Maintaining high visibility and strong relationships with Online TAs is essential for attracting guests.
