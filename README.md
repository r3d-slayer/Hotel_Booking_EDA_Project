An in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a hotel booking dataset to uncover trends and insights into booking patterns, cancellations, and guest demographics.

üìù About The Project
This project performs a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a hotel booking dataset containing data for a City Hotel and a Resort Hotel. The primary objective is to analyze booking patterns, identify factors influencing cancellations, and uncover key insights that can help optimize hotel management, pricing strategies, and customer service.

The dataset includes a wide range of variables such as booking dates, lead time, length of stay, guest demographics, country of origin, market segment, and booking status.

Built With
This analysis was conducted using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment. The primary libraries used are:

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

üìä Visualizations
The analysis relies on a variety of visualizations to extract insights from the dataset. The key charts created include:

Distribution of Bookings: Count plots to compare bookings between City and Resort hotels.

Seasonal Booking Trends: Line charts to identify peak and off-peak booking months.

Cancellation Rate Analysis: Bar charts to visualize cancellation rates by hotel type.

Guest Origin: Bar charts to display the top 10 countries with the most bookings.

Market Segment Distribution: Pie charts to understand the proportion of bookings from various segments like Online TA, Offline TA/TO, and Direct.

üìä Key Insights from the Analysis
1. City Hotels Dominate Bookings
The analysis revealed that City Hotels have a significantly higher number of bookings compared to Resort Hotels, accounting for over 66% of the total. This suggests a higher general demand or capacity for city-based accommodations.

2. Summer is the Peak Season
Booking demand fluctuates significantly throughout the year. The busiest month for hotels is August, followed closely by July. Conversely, the quietest period is during the winter, with January having the fewest bookings. This insight is crucial for staffing and marketing strategies.

3. High Cancellation Rate is a Major Concern
A substantial portion of bookings are canceled, with an overall cancellation rate of approximately 37%. City hotels have a slightly higher cancellation rate (41.7%) compared to resort hotels (27.7%). Addressing this is critical for improving revenue.

‚ú® Conclusion
The analysis provides several actionable insights for hotel management:

Focus on City Hotels: As the primary driver of bookings, strategies to optimize pricing and reduce cancellations should be focused on city hotels.

Implement Seasonal Strategies: Marketing campaigns and staffing levels should be adjusted to match peak (Summer) and off-peak (Winter) seasons.

Reduce Cancellations: With a cancellation rate of nearly 37%, implementing strategies like non-refundable offers, flexible booking policies, or improved guest communication is critical.

Leverage Online Channels: Maintaining high visibility and strong relationships with Online TAs is essential for attracting guests.
