## üìù About The Project

This project performs a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a hotel booking dataset containing data for a City Hotel and a Resort Hotel. The primary objective is to analyze booking patterns, identify factors influencing cancellations, and uncover key insights that can help optimize hotel management, pricing strategies, and customer service.

The dataset includes a wide range of variables such as booking dates, lead time, length of stay, guest demographics, country of origin, market segment, and booking status.

### Built With
This analysis was conducted using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment. The primary libraries used are:
* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)

## ‚ú® Conclusion

The analysis provides several actionable insights for hotel management:

* **Focus on City Hotels:** As the primary driver of bookings, strategies to optimize pricing and reduce cancellations should be focused on city hotels.
* **Implement Seasonal Strategies:** Marketing campaigns and staffing levels should be adjusted to match peak (Summer) and off-peak (Winter) seasons.
* **Reduce Cancellations:** With a cancellation rate of nearly 37%, implementing strategies like non-refundable offers or improved guest communication is critical.
* **Leverage Online Channels:** Maintaining high visibility and strong relationships with Online TAs is essential for attracting guests.
